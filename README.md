# Component-based Rails Applications (CBRA) - Source Code to the Book

This repository holds all source code used in my book on [Component-based Rails Applications](https://leanpub.com/cbra).

## How the CBRA book is being published

CBRA is being published lean. That means, that I publish every section of the book as soon as I complete it. I will announce major updates via leanpub announcement feature (which you will receive if you [buy the book](https://leanpub.com/cbra)) and smaller ones via twitter as [@shageman](https://twitter.com/shageman).

I am very much interested in feedback on the book an invite you to use the [leanpub discussion page](https://leanpub.com/cbra/feedback), [email](https://leanpub.com/cbra/email_author/new), or [twitter](https://twitter.com/shageman) to do so. For general discussions of component-based Rails, please use the [CBRA google group](http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/components-in-rails).

The price of this book is as-is and will probably not change during the leanpub publishing process. I know it's a pretty steep price to start with, but see it as a kickstarter campaign to give me extra motivation to continue writing and for your feedback to have lots of influence.

The calculation of percent complete assumes that the book will be 250 pages in the end. That is, of course, just one big guess.

## How to use this repository

The repository is organized by book chapter and section. If a section adds no code that is specific to it, it may use the source code from the last section preceding it that does have source code samples attached (Section 2.3 is an example of this).

The paths to files given in the book assume the root of the application or gem being the current directory.
